# project-server
The goal of this project is to learn ubuntu, linux commands, Web, full-stack development, programming, scripting, hosting and managing of a website.
Configuration of server, managing it's integrity, Securing it, learning about monitoring the network and traffic. 

First and foremost I configured and enabled SSH for my server locally, just to get the hang of it. Edited the sshd_conf file, so that it is secure on somelevel. Such as disabling root login. Setting up SSH keys to authenticate. 
After it was done. I navigated through nginx web server and reverse proxy tools, to host a simple "index.html". As i moved on, I used "goaccess" to monitor and see how it maintains logs and how the traffic comes, requests in real-time.
This was quite complex to navigate rememeber what I have done and what was happening. With the help of git I could make changes, revert it back and experiment. Temporarily was able to create a self signed certificate and authenticate with the help of openSSL, so that I could connect to it using **https** protocol.
